🗄️ Database Setup Options
This repository includes two options for setting up your database:

1. Step-by-Step Setup: Each part of the tutorial includes SQL snippets for creating only the necessary tables and records for that section (check the db folder -> part2.sql ~ part5.sql). This option is ideal if you are following along with the tutorial series and using the UI on the deployed website to create records.

2. Full Database Setup with all_db.sql: If you'd like to set up the entire database with all tables and records at once, or if you've missed any steps in the tutorial, you can use the (check the db folder -> all_db.sql) file. This script includes all SQL commands needed to create databases, tables, and insert data, ensuring your database is complete without following every step in the tutorial.
